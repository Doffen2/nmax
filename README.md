The Grude Nmax Hypothesis proposes a scalar boson field, Nmax (~1.78e-17 eV, Compton
wavelength ~0.465 AU), as a counterbalance to the Higgs field in a yin-yang duality. Developed by a
ham radio operator with a wave-based perspective, Nmax limits spacetime curvature, prevents
singularities, stabilizes wormholes, and produces neutrinos via Higgs interactions. It addresses
unresolved issues in general relativity, such as the information paradox and exotic matter
requirements, by introducing a field equation that caps curvature at ~0.465 AU. Testable signatures
include gravitational wave anomalies (LISA, Taiji), lensing deviations (Event Horizon Telescope),
neutrino bursts (IceCube, DUNE), and CMB anisotropies (LiteBIRD), urging a fearless rethinking of
spacetime's fundamental limits.
